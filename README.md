**NOTICE! This is still in beta, some stuff may get bypassed in the filter when you make the filter.**

SkFilter is a skript addon based upon making filters for your server more easy and desirable. SkFilter introduces a new way to blacklist/whitelist words & links with a simple pattern recognition system that matches words. Seeing the filter list is just you adding words to the filter, you can iterate through a list of words and add them manually at any point in time. You can view the documentation for this on SkriptHub.
